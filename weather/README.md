Rainfall in Seattle, WA vs Portland, ME

Project Overview:
This project is an analysis of whether it rains more in Seattle, WA or Portland, ME. It uses data on daily precipitation in each of the two cities between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022. The key finding was that it rains more in Portland, ME than Seattle, WA.

Data:
Precipitation data was sourced from National Centers for Environmental Information NOAA Climate Data tool: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND

Analysis:
The data was cleaned by removing all data columns except date and precipitation, removing entries with null values, and removing entries outside of the desired time frame. The data was used to find descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles, min/max), and converted into a box plot of average rainfall by month, a bar graph of average rainfall by month, and a bar graph of proportion of days that received precipitation by month.

Results:
It rains more in Portland, ME than Seattle, WA, but Seattle has a greater proportion of rainy days. Portland also has more variation in rainfall, with some large outliers that could skew the mean.
